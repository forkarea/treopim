# Attributes

 **Attributes** - are characteristics of a certain product which make it distinct from other products, eg size, color, functionality, components and features that affect the product's appeal or acceptance in the market.  

An Attribute can be assigned to only one Attribute Group. Value for the certain attribute set for a certain product is called product attribute value.  It it possible to define the same product attribute separate values for each channel. 

Attribute can be assigned to several Product Families, so it the product for that product family is created, the selected attribute will be added to the product attributes automatically.

Attributes can be activated or deactivated. Deactivated attributes cannot be used in the system, e.g. no values can be set to them or transfered via any channel. All the values of the deactivated attributes are hidden and will be shown again after the attribute is activated again.
